Higher-Lower is a terminal-based Python game where players guess which country has a higher Human Development Index (HDI) rank. The lower the rank number, the better the country's HDI.

üéØ Objective
Compare two randomly selected countries and guess which one has the higher HDI rank (i.e., the lower numerical rank). Keep guessing correctly to increase your score!

üß† How It Works
Two countries are shown with their names and HDI ranks.
You guess whether Country A or Country B has the higher rank.
If you're correct, your score increases and the game continues.
If you're wrong, the game ends and your final score is displayed.

üõ†Ô∏è Features
Randomized country comparisons
Score tracking
Clean terminal interface with bold text and screen clearing
Uses ANSI escape codes for formatting
Prevents duplicate country comparisons
